# PDFormerFlow-traffic-prediction
# Introduction
PDFormerFlow is an improved traffic flow prediction model that builds upon PDFormer and incorporates Flow-by-Flow modeling principles. PDFormerFlow inherits PDFormer's advantages in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and long-range spatial dependencies and introduces new features to optimize traffic flow prediction performance. At the same time, PDFormerFlow draws inspiration from flow-by-flow models to better model the temporal dynamics of traffic flow. This implementation adapts the core strengths of PDFormer to describe the intricate relationships in flow-by-flow traffic matrices. The model can capture both spatial relationships (based on physical proximity of OD endpoints) and temporal relationships to effectively predict traffic flows. 
# Key Features

    üöÄ Flow-centric architecture: Models traffic as origin-destination (OD) pairs rather than individual nodes

    üåê Dual relationship modeling: Captures both geometric (spatial) and semantic (pattern-based) flow relationships

    ‚è±Ô∏è Temporal attention: Learns complex time-dependent patterns in traffic flows

    üìà Curriculum learning: Gradually increases prediction horizon during training

    ‚ö° Efficient implementation: Optimized for GPU acceleration

# The Extention  

  PDFormerFlow builds upon the original PDFormer architecture with these key enhancements:

    Flow-based representation:

        Treats each origin-destination pair as a separate flow

        Models flow-to-flow relationships instead of node-to-node

    Flow positional encoding:

        Combines origin and destination node features

        Creates unique embeddings for each OD pair

    Flow relationship masks:

        Geometric mask based on physical distance between flows

        Semantic mask based on traffic pattern similarity

    Efficient attention mechanisms:

        Factorized attention over flows

        Pattern-enhanced geometric attention
# Dataset
